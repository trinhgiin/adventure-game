# Adventure game ⚔️


In this project, I made a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. The character enters in a magic adventure world where they fight monsters and make the right choices to achieve to victory.

## How to play:

In the terminal, execute `python3 adventure_game.py`, follow the intruction and make your choices. Good luck!

## Technology used: 
* Python
